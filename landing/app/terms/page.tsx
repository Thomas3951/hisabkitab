        <p>
          A bookkeeping assistant. It prepares figures and shows its work. <strong>It does not file your
          tax returns and is not a substitute for a licensed accountant.</strong> You remain responsible
          for what you file with the IRD.

          Review every entry before approving it, file your returns on the IRD portal yourself, and keep
          your account credentials safe. Nothing is saved to your books without your approval — which
          means accuracy of approvals is on you.

          The service is offered free during the pilot, as-is, and may change as we improve it. You can
