          Send a photo, a PDF, or a line of text. The agent reads messy receipts —
          faded thermal paper, handwritten totals, mixed Nepali and English — and pulls out the
          vendor, date, amounts, and VAT. <strong>When a field is unclear, it asks instead of
          guessing.</strong> Nothing is invented to fill a blank.

      <Section id="vat-tds" title="VAT &amp; TDS">
        <p>
          Nepal&apos;s 13% VAT, computed in whole paisa with integer math so totals always reconcile.
          It handles inclusive and exclusive pricing, checks input-credit eligibility (Rule 17 vs the
          abbreviated 17Ka bill, and the one-year claim window), and applies TDS on the
          VAT-exclusive base. <strong>Ambiguous cases route to a human accountant — it never
          estimates a tax number.</strong> See the <a className="text-primary underline-offset-4 hover:underline" href="/vat-guide">Nepal VAT guide</a> for the full rules.

      <Section id="payments" title="Payments">
        <p>
          Collect through Khalti and the sale records itself — <strong>exactly once</strong>, with an
          idempotency key so a retried message can never double-count. Every payment is verified
          against the gateway before it touches your books.
        </p>

      <Section id="reports" title="Reports">
        <p>
          Clean PDF reports rendered only from validated data: VAT summaries, AR/AP aging by party,
          and month-end statements. If a figure can&apos;t be reconciled, the report holds it and tells
          you why rather than shipping a wrong number.
        </p>

      <Section id="reminders" title="Reminders">
        <p>
          Before the 25th of each Nepali month — the IRD filing deadline — the agent prepares your
          return, self-verifies the numbers, and nudges you to review and file. You file on the IRD
          portal yourself; <strong>it never files for you.</strong>
