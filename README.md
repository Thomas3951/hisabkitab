# HisabKitab (हिसाबकिताब) — your pocket accountant on WhatsApp

> **Log a bill by photo or voice. Get VAT-ready in seconds. You approve every entry — it never guesses.**

WhatsApp-first bookkeeping & tax assistant for small VAT-registered businesses in Nepal, built on
Claude Managed Agents. *Hisab-kitab* is the everyday Nepali phrase for "keeping the books" — that is
exactly, and only, what this product does.

**The promise (process guarantee, not "zero mistakes"):** nothing is ever saved or filed without the
owner's confirmation. The agent shows its work, flags anything it's unsure about, and never guesses.

## Docs
- `CLAUDE.md` — build rules and process (authoritative).
- `docs/PRODUCT.md` — product one-pager + spec map.
- `docs/nepali-smb-finance-agent-PRD*.md` — v1.0 base, v1.1 (safety + verified tax, authoritative),
  v1.2 (reports module), v2.0 (commercialization — build after the pilot).

## Status — Phases 0–3 complete

**Phase 3** ships the WhatsApp layer in `packages/orchestrator`: a Fastify webhook server
(Meta handshake + `X-Hub-Signature-256` verified over the raw bytes), zod-parsed inbound
envelopes, **exactly-once** processing (Meta retries dedupe on the `wa_events` PK), per-tenant
message serialization, onboarding/pairing ("START 4821" binds the number, activates the tenant,
consumes the code, audit-logs), a persistent per-tenant session registry (`tenant_sessions`),
media→Files (Graph download → Files API → container mount at `/workspace/inbox/...`), outbound
replies through the Audit Gate, and the three Utility templates ready to submit
(`templates:submit`). Migration `0002` adds the `hisab_orch` webhook role (cross-tenant by
design — the orchestrator mints the tenant tokens) while `hisab_app` stays RLS-scoped.
Verified live (`verify:wa -- --live`, 9/9): signed webhook → pairing → real agent session →
a blank "bill" image was mounted into the container and the agent **asked for a clearer photo
instead of inventing data**.

**Phase 2** ships `packages/orchestrator`: the Managed Agents agent definition (frozen system
prompt, ledger MCP wiring, the three skills synced via the Skills API), idempotent one-time
`agent:setup` (skills → environment → agent), per-tenant **vaults** holding the HMAC-signed
ledger bearer, the session client (stream-first event loop, one session = one tenant), and the
**Pre-delivery Audit Gate** in the relay path — every outbound money figure must be traceable to
a same-turn ledger tool result or the message is held, the agent is told to re-verify or ask the
owner, and the decision is logged to `audit_log`. Verified live against the real API
(`pnpm --filter @hisab/orchestrator verify:live -- --session`): the scope guardrail declined an
off-topic question, and the gate held an unverified VAT figure end-to-end.

**Phase 1** ships `packages/db` (Postgres 16+ schema via drizzle, **Row-Level Security** on every
tenant table — fails closed, app role cannot bypass) and `packages/mcp-ledger` (a tenant-bound MCP
server over Streamable HTTP: record/validate/draft→confirm tools, tenant derived only from
HMAC-signed session metadata, every write audited). 24 contract tests run a real MCP client against
real Postgres as the RLS-constrained role; `pnpm --filter @hisab/mcp-ledger verify` drives the live
HTTP server. See `packages/db/migrations/0001_init.sql` for the schema.

### Phase 0
`packages/shared` ships the foundations, each with happy fixtures **and adversarial probes**:

| Unit | What it does |
|---|---|
| `money` | Integer-paisa (`bigint`) arithmetic, exact half-up rounding, NPR lakh formatting, strict parsing |
| `config/tax` | FY 2082/83 rates as config (env-overridable, zod-validated) — never scattered literals |
| `vat` | Inclusive/exclusive 13% math (`excl+vat===total` invariant), carry-forward, Sec 18 input-credit eligibility (Rule 17 vs 17Ka, 1-year window) |
| `tds` | All v1.1 §5.2 categories on the VAT-exclusive base; ambiguous cases return `ask_accountant`, never an estimate |
| `bsdate` | BS↔AD via pinned `nepali-date-converter`, month ranges, 25th-of-next-month VAT deadline |
| `aging` | AR/AP aging buckets (current/1–30/31–60/61–90/90+), independent report re-verification |
| `validation` | Layer-2 Validation Engine: `pass`/`warn`/`fail` checks (VAT math, totals, credit, duplicates, TDS base, sanity) |
| `verification` | `PASS\|FAIL\|BLOCKED\|SKIP` verdicts shared by human + agent + CI |

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test        # vitest: 84 tests
pnpm verify      # runtime verification: 16 checks incl. 10 adversarial probes
pnpm typecheck   # tsc --strict
```

## Next
Phase 4: bill-extraction confirmation loop end-to-end (test with real messy bills). Requires a
Meta business + number (webhook is ready) and a public https deployment of the Ledger MCP.
