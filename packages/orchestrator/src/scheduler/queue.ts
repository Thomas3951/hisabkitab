/**
 * BullMQ wiring for the monthly reminder (PRD v1.0 §8.5 "Queue/scheduler: BullMQ
 * + Redis"). A single repeatable job fans out to runReminderPass.
 *
 * Why this is safe at any tick cadence
 * ------------------------------------
 * Exactly-once is owned by the DB (reminder_log unique key), NOT by the queue.
 * That decoupling is deliberate and is what makes the queue logic robust:
 *   - The job runs DAILY, not once-a-month. A node that was down on "the" day
 *     recovers the next day instead of skipping the whole month.
 *   - Re-runs are free: every tenant already nudged this BS month hits the
 *     reminder_log latch and sends nothing. So we can retry on failure, run
 *     multiple replicas, or trigger a manual pass without fear of double-sends.
 *   - Therefore the worker only needs at-LEAST-once delivery from BullMQ, which
 *     is exactly what BullMQ guarantees — we lean into it rather than fighting it.
 *
 * Hardening applied:
 *   - deterministic scheduler id (upsert replaces, never accumulates schedules)
 *   - retry with exponential backoff, capped attempts (transient Redis/PG blips)
 *   - bounded retention (removeOnComplete / removeOnFail) so Redis can't grow
 *     without limit from a daily job
 *   - per-pass result is returned & logged for observability
 *   - graceful close (drain worker, then queue)
